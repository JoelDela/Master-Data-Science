    "\n",
    "There are a number of problems faced by the vanilla mini-batch GD, as explained by Sebastian Ruder in this [excellent post](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult**. A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning rate schedules try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additionally, **the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates**. If our data is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another **key challenge** of minimizing highly non-convex error functions common for neural networks is **avoiding getting trapped in their numerous suboptimal local minima**. Dauphin et al. [19] argue that the difficulty arises in fact not from local minima but from **saddle points**, i.e. points where one dimension slopes up and another slopes down. These saddle points are usually surrounded by a plateau of the same error, which makes it notoriously hard for SGD to escape, as the gradient is close to zero in all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this last point, we have: \n",

    "* **Ill-conditioning of the Hessian matrix**: regions where the curvature around one variable is much larger than in other directions (like in a ravine).\n",

    "SGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply in one dimension than in another, which are common around local optima.
