    "It is an open source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures (of individual machines, or racks of machines) are common and thus should be automatically handled in software by the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part (Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)) and a processing part (MapReduce). Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them amongst the nodes in the cluster. To process the data, Hadoop MapReduce transfers packaged code for nodes to process in parallel, based on the data each node needs to process. This approach takes advantage of data locality — nodes manipulating the data that they have on hand — to allow the data to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are connected via high-speed networking.\n",
