Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them amongst the nodes in the cluster. To process the data, Hadoop MapReduce transfers packaged code for nodes to process in parallel, based on the data each node needs to process. This approach takes advantage of data locality — nodes manipulating the data that they have on hand — to allow the data to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are connected via high-speed networking.\n","\n","![Map/shuffle/reduce](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/datasciencewebinar061312-120618165932-phpapp02/95/how-salesforcecom-uses-hadoop-41-728.jpg?cb=1340920667)\n","\n","Since data and computation are distributed, we should avoid the use of variables, i.e. mutable data.
