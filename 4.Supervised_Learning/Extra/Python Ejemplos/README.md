# Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn

Based on Machine Learning Practices by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham)

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the semi-automated extraction of knowledge from data.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Supervised Learning

- Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs
- Example: Titanic Kaggle Competition

#### 1.1 How does Supervised Learning works?

- TRAIN a machine learning model using LABELED DATA
    - LABELED DATA has been labeled with the outcome
    - Machine Learning model learns the relationship between the incomes and the outcome
- PREDICTION on new data for which the outcome label is unknown

#### 1.2 How do i choose which attributes of my data to include in the model?

#### 1.3 How do i choose which model to use?

#### 1.4 How do i optimise this model for the best performance?

#### 1.5 How do i ensure that i am building a model that generalise to unseen data?

#### 1.6 Can i estimate how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?

 
### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points
- Example: Segment grocery store shoppers into clusters that exhibit similar behaviors
