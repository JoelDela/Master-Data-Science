# Dependencies to Run the Notebooks

We need to make sure we have the dependencies installed working in Python 3.

## Create a Virtual Environment

Please, always use some kind of virtual environment, so that the installed libraries don't interfere with the system Python installation. Let's call it `nlp`. 

There are multiple ways of doing this, but the current standard way seems to be using the `venv` module:

    python3 -m venv nlp
    source nlp/bin/activate

If you'd rather use `conda`, check the documentation, but the following should work:

    conda create -n nlp python=3.7 anaconda
    source activate nlp

Then, you can disable the current virtual environment with the
following command:

    deactivate

Or:

    conda deactivate

## `nltk`

Install `nltk` and download some data collections and models:

    pip install nltk
    python -m nltk.downloader book
    python -m nltk.downloader cess_esp

## `textblob`

Just run:

    pip install textblob

## `spaCy`

To install `spaCy` and download at least some common models (for Spanish and English), run:

    pip install spacy
    python -m spacy download es_core_news_md
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

If you have any problems with these two last commands, try to install the models as if they were Python libraries. Run:

    pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/es_core_news_md
    pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_md

## `flair`

Install `flair` by running:

    pip install flair

Notice that additional pretrained models will be downloaded, if needed. This may take a while.

## `gensim`

Just run:

    pip install gensim

## PyTorch, BERT and OpenAI language models

Check the [Pytorch Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the library according to your actual settings.

With the following commands you'll probably be just fine:

    pip install torch torchvision

If you have a CPU-only computer, try:

    pip install torch==1.4.0+cpu torchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Lastly, install the `transformers` library, by HuggingFace:

    pip install transformers
