    "Discrete data would most often be transformed by [one-hot encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f), which is [very easy to do in pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html).\n",

    "With high cardinality discrete data such as airports or, especially, tail numbers, we would be left with many variables, most of which would not be very informative. There are [several options](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/encoding-methodologies) to deal with this. The most sophisticated is probably vector encoding, but we can do with a very simple approach: [target encoding](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding-done-the-right-way/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we substitute each value of the discrete variable by the average or median value of the target variable for that value of the independent discrete variable. However! if we want to use this in machine learning for predictions, we would need to use only the previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target encode the variable 'Origin' and the 'Tail_Number' variable, using for each cell only the values that were available the previous day. In other words: create a `median_delay_origin` variable that contains, for each record, the median delay at that airport _up to the previous day_. Create another one, `median_delay_plane`, with Tail_Number."
