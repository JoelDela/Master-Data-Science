# Master-Data-Science
This repo will contain the information acquired during the master. It will be divided in the different areas of study, which are represented by a folder. Inside this folders, an 'Extra' folder can be found, in which I will upload content I'll be finding in GitHub or the Internet about this topics or the Master itself.
